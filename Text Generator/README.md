This project use a corpus.txt file that contains the entire script of Game of Thrones.
As the file will be used to "train" a probabilistic model that will predict the next word in a chain of words, 
the generated text will resemble the style and vocabulary of the source material.
This program implement a simple text generator using Markov chains. A Markov chain is a statistical 
model in which the probability of each event depends on the previous event.
